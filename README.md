**FSL-Mate** is a collection of resources for few-shot learning (FSL).  

In particular, FSL-Mate currently contains

- [**FewShotPapers**](https://github.com/tata1661/FSL-Mate/tree/master/FewShotPapers): a paper list which tracks the research advances on FSL
- [**PaddleFSL**](https://github.com/tata1661/FSL-Mate/tree/master/PaddleFSL): a PaddlePaddle-based python library for FSL 

We are endeavored to constantly update FSL-Mate. Hopefully, it can make FSL easier.
